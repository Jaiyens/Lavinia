## Brand & Style

Terra is an **operating system for California farmers**; this surface is its first agent, the PG&E energy tool. The aesthetic is **editorial agrarian-luxury**: calm, confident, expensive. It must read like the pitch deck, not a SaaS template.

The emotional target is **control through legibility**: a skeptical, low-software-literacy grower opens the app and *feels he can see his whole farm and knows what is happening on it.* Every visual choice serves that feeling. Hierarchy comes from weight and size, not decoration. The data hero — the chart, table, and map — is the loudest thing on the screen; money reads clearly as the story it tells, never a lone hero number. Everything else recedes to hairlines and warm paper.

**Refined minimalism, now with motivated motion and soft depth.** This is the 2026-06-15 reconciliation of the original restraint-first spine with the Magic-UI-era direction: we retire the blanket "no effects / one motion moment" clause, but we do *not* become a flashy SaaS toy. The bar is **restrained polish** (think Linear and Vercel, tuned to warm farm paper), not Awwwards. Effects serve legibility, never decorate:

- A soft lift on hover says *this is touchable*.
- A number that counts up once on load lets the grower *watch the dollars land*.
- A bar chart that grows from its baseline lets him *read magnitude as it builds*.

Every animation must be **motivated** — it communicates hierarchy, a state change, feedback, or a data story. If you cannot say in one sentence what an animation communicates, cut it. **Motion dials for this product (trust-first preset): variance low, motion low, density medium.** Still banned: glassmorphism, liquid glass, heavy or neon gradients, decorative infinite loops, and any third status color. When a Magic UI or Aceternity component is used, it is **tinted into the warm palette** (beams and shimmer in greens and golds, never default neon) and reserved for moments that earn it.

Voice in the UI is plain operator English: confident, never salesy, no exclamation marks, no em dashes. The grower's words — blocks, sets, hours, acres, pumps, ranches — never kW or "15-minute interval."

## Colors

One dominant color, one sharp accent, and a single restrained alert tone. Everything else is cool neutral.

- **Brand green `primary #2FA84F`** is the dominant color — navigation, primary actions, the in-the-money state, and the tint for any beam or shimmer effect.
- **Cool light-grey paper `surface #EEF1F5`** is the canvas, never pure white. Containers step through cool greys (`surface-container-*`).
- **Charcoal `on-surface #16181D`** is the ink, never pure black. Secondary text is muted cool grey `on-surface-variant #5B6470`.
- **`money-positive #2FA84F`** is reserved for *positive money*: savings found, credits, in-the-money deltas. The reskin unified it to the brand green, so it is no longer a distinct second green.
- **`alert #BD4B34`** — a warm clay/terracotta, the single alert tone. Used sparingly for `act`-severity findings and high-dollar-at-risk map pins. The traffic-light "bad," kept warm so it belongs to the agrarian palette rather than a SaaS red.
- **`gold #F2C14E`** — not a content color. It exists only as the warm second stop for the `primary → gold` border beam / shimmer on the one "live" hero moment (the Energy agent card). Never used for text, state, or fills.
- **`watch` severity has no dedicated color.** It is carried by typography and label only. Three content colors max on any screen: green, clay, charcoal-on-paper.

Borders are hairline `outline-variant #D9D4C6` at 1px. **Color consistency lock:** green is the only accent; clay is the only alert. A green-accented screen does not grow a blue badge or a teal chip. Audit every component before shipping.

## Typography

**Inter across display, body, and data** (loaded via next/font), Arial as the system fallback. There is exactly one typeface. Hierarchy is built from **weight extremes (300/400 against 700)** and **real size jumps**, never from mixing families. (Inter is the deliberate, brand-mandated choice for a low-literacy audience and supersedes the stale "Helvetica" note in the original decision log.)

- `money-hero` and `display-lg` carry dollar figures and section titles in heavy weight with tight tracking.
- **All numeric, dollar, and usage values use tabular figures** (`num-tabular`, `fontVariantNumeric: tabular-nums`) so columns of meter costs align to the digit. Non-negotiable on the table, the KPI strip, the drawer, and the findings rail.
- Numbers that represent a headline quantity (KPI value, found savings, meter count) **count up once on load** via NumberTicker, landing on the exact tabular value. The animation is data, not decoration; reduced-motion renders the final value instantly.
- `label-caps` (tracked out, uppercase) labels KPI cards, lens tabs, and rail section headers.
- Body sits at `body-md`/`body-lg`; captions and metadata at `caption`.

## Layout & Spacing

An **8px spacing scale** with generous margins. One primary decision per screen; depth is one tap away.

The desktop/tablet power surface is a **three-zone inverted-L + copilot**: `agent-rail` (240px, left) · data hero (fluid center) · `findings-rail` (320px, right). The center hero stacks: KPI strip → lens toggle → the active lens (chart / table / map / calendar) → shared drawer overlay.

Mobile is the core, not an afterthought: the agent rail becomes a bottom tab bar, the center goes full width, and the findings rail collapses to a peeking bottom sheet. Side margins hold at `margin-mobile` (20px) so content feels framed, never edge-bled. Every multi-column layout declares its `< 768px` collapse explicitly; the dense table degrades to a card list, never a pinched grid.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is now a **defined five-step scale**, warm-tinted, low-opacity, large-blur — a soft light on paper, never a sharp drop shadow and never a bright card on white. Tonal warm-paper layering still does most of the work; elevation is added on top of tone, not instead of it. This replaces the original "border before shadow, shadows only on the drawer" rule: cards may now rest at `e1` and lift to `e2` on hover.

- **`e0-flat`** — the paper base and flush table cells. Structure comes from `surface-container-*` tone and hairline `outline-variant`.
- **`e1-resting`** — the resting state of every card (KPI card, finding card, agent card, meter card). A whisper of a shadow plus an optional hairline border. This is the depth that was missing and made the old UI read flat.
- **`e2-hover`** — interactive lift. Any clickable card or row raises to `e2` and shifts by `{elevation.hover-lift}` over `{motion.duration-fast}`. Communicates "touchable."
- **`e3-overlay`** — the meter drawer, the mobile bottom sheet, popovers, and chart tooltips. The first level that reads as floating above the page.
- **`e4-modal`** — modal dialogs and the top of any stacking context. Used rarely.

Shadows are tinted to the page hue (`rgba(20,25,15,...)`), never pure black. **Focus** is a 2px paper-offset ring in `primary` (`{elevation.focus-ring}`) — visible on keyboard nav, suppressed on mouse where a hover lift already gives feedback.

## Shapes

**Soft (0.375rem default).** Sharp edges feel aggressive; pills feel tech-y. Subtle rounding reads calm and tactile. Larger objects — drawer, bottom sheet, map frame, modals, hero cards — use `lg` (0.75rem) or `xl` (1rem). The map and any imagery follow the same radius so everything feels framed.

**Shape consistency lock:** one radius scale, applied by role, everywhere. Controls (buttons, inputs, chips, KPI cards) = `DEFAULT`. Content cards = `lg`. Overlays and the map = `lg`/`xl`. Pills (`full`) appear only on the lens-toggle thumb and status dots. A square card on a page of soft cards is broken design.

## Motion & Animation

The house motion grammar. Tokens live in frontmatter `motion`; every value below references them so implementation and spec cannot drift.

- **Chrome motion is short and functional.** Hover, focus, color, and elevation transitions run at `{motion.duration-fast}` (180ms) with `{motion.easing-standard}`. Lens swaps and panel changes crossfade at `{motion.duration-base}` (240ms).
- **Entrance motion is one orchestrated reveal per view.** On first paint, a view's primary children fade-and-rise (`opacity 0→1`, `translateY 8px→0`) staggered by `{motion.stagger}` (60ms), at `{motion.duration-slow}` (420ms). Kept from the original spine — it is the calm "the farm assembles in front of you" beat. It fires once, not on every re-render.
- **Data motion earns the longest durations.** NumberTickers count up and chart bars grow from baseline at `{motion.duration-data}` (900ms) with `{motion.spring-data}` — no overshoot, no bounce. This is the only place motion is "slow," because the motion *is* the information.
- **Tactile feedback is mandatory on every control.** `:active` applies `{elevation.press}` (`scale 0.98`) and/or a 1px downward nudge, so a tap feels like a physical push. Buttons, rows, chips, toggle thumbs.
- **The drawer and bottom sheet** slide in (`e3` overlay) at `{motion.duration-slow}` with `{motion.easing-standard}`; exit uses `{motion.easing-exit}`.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` is honored everywhere** — all of the above collapse to instant final states (no transforms, tickers jump to value, bars render at height). This is non-negotiable; a grower with motion sensitivity sees a complete, static, correct screen.
- **Motivated-only rule:** every animation answers "what does this communicate?" (hierarchy / state change / feedback / data story). No marquees, no perpetual loops, no scroll-hijack, no parallax. The one decorative exception is the `BorderBeam` on the single live "Energy" agent card, whose job is to say *this one is alive and ready*.

## Components

Per-component visual specs. The five the slice rebuilds first — **card, kpi-card, meter-table, cost-chart, finding-card** — carry the most detail.

- **card** *(shared primitive, new)* — the base surface for KPI cards, finding cards, agent cards, and mobile meter cards. `surface-container-lowest` fill, `rounded.lg`, resting at `{elevation.e1-resting}` with an optional hairline `outline-variant`. If interactive: hover → `{elevation.e2-hover}` + `{elevation.hover-lift}` over `{motion.duration-fast}`; `:active` → `{elevation.press}`; keyboard focus → `{elevation.focus-ring}`. One card variant, used everywhere; this is what replaces today's flat 1px boxes.
- **kpi-card** — a `card`, compact. `label-caps` heading + a `num-tabular` value rendered with **NumberTicker** (counts up once on load) + a small sparkline + a vs-prior delta (delta arrow in `money-positive`/`primary` when favorable, `alert` clay when adverse). Honest-coverage line in `caption` when data is partial. Never a lone hero number; a strip of 3–4 sits above the lens. Loading → a **skeleton** matching the card's exact shape (never a spinner). Hover lifts to `e2`; click filters/opens the drawer.
- **meter-table** — the Excel-brained bridge, upgraded for density *and* polish. Header row is **sticky** and gains `e1` shadow once the body scrolls beneath it. Rows are flush (`e0`) with hairline `outline-variant` dividers; row hover → `surface-container-low` fill plus a 2px `primary` accent bar that slides in on the left edge (`{motion.duration-fast}`); the open/active row holds `surface-container-high` + a persistent accent bar. Sortable headers show a chevron; on sort the rows re-flow at `{motion.duration-base}`. `$`-at-risk cells above threshold tint to `alert-container` with `on-alert-container` text (verified WCAG AA). All figures tabular. First load reveals rows with the view stagger. **Mobile:** collapses to a list of `card` rows (meter name + headline cost + status), not a horizontally-scrolled table. Decorative motion stays out — this is data; its only motion is functional (sort, hover, reveal).
- **cost-chart** — the default hero visual: TOU-stacked bars (`peak` clay / `part-peak` outline / `off-peak` primary / `super-off-peak` primary-container) over time, dollars on the axis, year-over-year compare. Bars **grow from the baseline** on load, staggered ~40ms, at `{motion.duration-data}`. Bar hover → a `e3` tooltip (meter, total `$`, TOU breakdown) while the hovered bar brightens and siblings dim slightly (`{motion.duration-fast}`). YoY toggle animates bars to new heights at `{motion.duration-base}`. Reduced-motion → final heights instantly, tooltip still on hover/focus.
- **finding-card** — a `card` in the rail: situation line + one concrete action + dollar impact (`num-tabular`) + severity badge + a one-tap response. `act` cards carry a 2px `alert` left-edge accent; `watch` is type-only; `info` is neutral. A freshly arrived finding plays a one-time `pulse-once` (kept). Response row: primary **"Mark done"** (solid `primary`) + ghost **"Dismiss"**; both get `:active` `{elevation.press}`. Acting on a finding animates it through its **full state cycle** to a resolved/collapsed state (not just a silent disappear). Shaped to be executed by the agent later; v1 displays/records.
- **agent-rail** — vertical list of agents (icon + label). Active agent uses `primary`; the live **Energy** card carries the single `BorderBeam` (`primary → gold`, palette-tinted) as the "alive" moment; future agents render at reduced opacity with a "coming" tag and are non-interactive. Hover → `surface-container-low`. Collapses to a bottom tab bar on mobile.
- **lens-toggle** — segmented control: Chart · Table · Map · Calendar. Chart is the default face. One lens visible at a time. Active thumb uses `primary` and a `full`-radius pill that slides between segments at `{motion.duration-base}`.
- **meter-drawer** — right-side (desktop) / full-height sheet (mobile) at `{elevation.e3-overlay}`, opened from any chart bar, table row, or map pin. Slides in at `{motion.duration-slow}`. The single meter-detail surface, shared across lenses.
- **farm-map** — zoomable, read-only; meter pins colored by `$`-at-risk (green → clay), tap opens the drawer. Map frame uses `rounded.lg`. Renders fully from inventory (PLSS/geocode) on day one.
- **button** — primary: solid `primary` fill, `on-primary` text, generous horizontal padding, `rounded.DEFAULT`; hover lifts a touch with a slight brightness gain; `:active` → `{elevation.press}` + 1px nudge. Secondary: 1px `outline-variant` with `on-surface` text. One primary per screen. The single highest-intent CTA in a flow (e.g. onboarding "Connect your data") may use a palette-tinted ShimmerButton — at most once per screen. **Contrast + single-line label are mandatory** (WCAG AA; primary CTAs ≤ 3 words).
- **input** — minimalist; `label-caps` above the field (never placeholder-as-label); hairline box in `outline-variant` going to `primary` on focus with the focus ring; helper text below in `caption`; error text below in `alert`.
- **severity-badge** — `info` / `watch` / `act`. `act` = `alert` fill/accent; `watch` = charcoal weight + label, no fill; `info` = muted. No fourth state, no extra hue.
- **bottom-sheet** — mobile findings collapse: a peeking summary ("3 findings · ~$78k ↑") at `e3` that expands to the rail's content; drag/tap to expand at `{motion.duration-slow}`.
- **skeleton** *(new)* — loading placeholder that matches the final element's shape and rhythm (card outline, table rows, chart baseline). A slow shimmer in `surface-container` → `surface-container-high`. Replaces every spinner; the layout never jumps when data lands.
- **almond-launcher** *(new)* — the operator copilot's resting state: a circular FAB-scale button in **brand dark-green `#1F3D2B`** holding the **`almond-mascot`** ("On the button" state — its sprout lightened to `#4E9A63` for contrast on the dark fill), resting `{elevation.e1-resting}`, hover → `e2` + `{elevation.hover-lift}`, `:active` → `{elevation.press}`. Never pulses, never badges, never auto-opens. On first visit only, the one-time `coachmark` points to it.
- **almond-panel** *(new)* — the conversation surface, opened from the launcher at `{elevation.e3-overlay}`; desktop = floating panel, mobile = full-height sheet (same grammar as `meter-drawer`). Slides in at `{motion.duration-slow}`, closes to the screen it came from. Streams answers into an `aria-live` region. Holds the composer, conversation, `action-chip`s, skill previews, and `artifact-card`s.
- **action-chip** *(new)* — a compact `rounded.DEFAULT` chip in the panel recording a navigation Almond performed ("Opened Pump 21"); `surface-container-low`, `label`/`caption` type, a small lead icon, hover lift, `:active` press; tapping re-applies that view. Reads as a record of what happened, not a destructive control.
- **artifact-card** *(new)* — a `card` in the panel for a finished file: a kind glyph (sheet / PDF), the file name, an honest coverage/as-of line in `caption`, and a primary **Download**. Any money inside is `num-tabular`, never a hero number. A saved copy appears in `reports-list`.
- **reports-list** *(new)* — in the Account page: a list of `card` rows, one per saved artifact (kind glyph, name, the request that made it, date, re-download). Empty state is calm ("Nothing saved yet"), not an apology. Farm-scoped; private.
- **coachmark** *(new)* — a single, dismissible one-time pointer to the launcher on first visit, in plain operator English ("Ask Almond to show your most expensive meter"), paired with the mascot's **First-login** halo state. Appears once, never returns; honors reduced-motion (no float). This is the whole of Almond's nudging — there is no second prompt, no badge, no recurring tip.
- **almond-mascot** *(new, identity)* — the Almond character and the source of its warmth: a warm almond nut (`#D9A36A` body, `#EFCB97` highlight, `#BE8049` shade, `#A8703A` seam) with a dark-green sprout (`#1F3D2B`/`#274E37`), charcoal eyes (`#3A2A1C`), and soft clay cheeks (`#E0875A`). It carries Almond's whole emotional range through small expression changes — the one place this product is allowed character. Gold `#C98A2B` is the only accent it adds (thinking dots, the done sparkle), consistent with the palette's golds. Canonical states (art: `imports/almond-mascot.svg`):
  - **Icon** — resting mascot; the agent's mark (rail entry, panel header).
  - **On the button** — mascot on the dark-green launcher FAB (sprout lightened to `#4E9A63` for contrast).
  - **Listening** — mascot inside a thin open ring; panel open, ready for input.
  - **Thinking** — eyes up + three ascending gold dots; the streaming / working state.
  - **Done** — closed-eye smile + a single gold sparkle; an action or artifact completed.
  - **First login** — mascot in a soft concentric halo; pairs with the one-time `coachmark`, then never returns.
  These expressions are the entirety of Almond's animation budget — calm, brief, motivated, reduced-motion-safe (the static expression still reads). No bounce, no idle loop, no perpetual motion.

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** make the data hero (chart, table, map) the loudest thing; money is the story it tells, never a lone hero number. Let everything else fall to hairlines and warm paper.
- **Do** give every card real but soft depth (`e1` resting, `e2` on hover). Flat 1px boxes are the old look we are leaving.
- **Do** make motion motivated and brief: feedback, hierarchy, state change, or a data story. If you can't name what it communicates, cut it.
- **Do** ship the **full interaction cycle** for every interactive element: resting, hover, `:active` (tactile press), focus, loading (skeleton), empty, and error. Never just the happy success state.
- **Do** use tabular figures everywhere a number appears, and count up headline numbers once on load.
- **Do** keep to three content colors on a screen: green, clay, charcoal-on-paper. Tint any beam/shimmer effect into greens/golds.
- **Do** verify WCAG AA contrast on every button, badge, input, and tinted `$`-at-risk cell before shipping.
- **Do** honor `prefers-reduced-motion` on every animation — instant, complete, correct static state.
- **Don't** build the 12-widget wall (the future-vision mock is the anti-pattern: stat soup + competing panels).
- **Don't** use pure white, pure black, glassmorphism, liquid glass, heavy/neon gradients, marquees, parallax, scroll-hijack, or perpetual decorative loops.
- **Don't** over-animate data tables; their motion is functional only (sort, hover accent, load reveal).
- **Don't** surface vanity metrics (soil %, health %) as heroes; the hero story is dollars.
- **Don't** mix typefaces or radius systems for hierarchy; use weight, size, and the one shape scale.
- **Don't** add a third status color; `watch` is typography, not a hue.
- **Do** keep Almond gentle: it opens only when summoned, nudges exactly once (the coachmark), and never badges, pulses, blocks, or nags. The grower came for the dashboard; Almond is on call, not in the way.
- **Don't** let Almond auto-open, stack notifications, or animate to draw attention. A pushy assistant loses a non-AI-native grower on the first session.
